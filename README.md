Zomato Data Analysis - Description
Objective:
The goal of this Zomato data analysis project is to explore and analyze the dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between various features of restaurants, such as ratings, locations, price ranges, cuisines, and customer reviews. The insights gathered can help businesses and food enthusiasts make informed decisions.

Dataset Overview:
The Zomato dataset typically includes information such as:

Restaurant Name: The name of the restaurant.
Location: The geographical area or city where the restaurant is located.
Cuisines: The type of food served (e.g., Indian, Italian, Chinese).
Average Cost for Two: The average cost for two people dining at the restaurant.
Rating: User ratings for the restaurant.
Number of Votes: The number of people who voted on the restaurant.
Online Order Availability: Whether the restaurant provides online ordering.
Book Table Option: Availability of table booking service.
Type of Restaurant: Whether it's a dine-in, delivery service, etc.
Steps for Zomato Data Analysis:
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and clean data fields (such as converting strings to numerical values or timestamps where necessary).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of Ratings: Analyze how restaurant ratings are distributed and if certain locations or cuisines have higher ratings.
Price Range Analysis: Understand how the price varies with location, cuisines, and restaurant types.
Votes and Ratings: Examine if there is a relationship between the number of votes a restaurant receives and its ratings.
Online Orders and Book Table Availability: Analyze the impact of online ordering and table booking on restaurant popularity or ratings.
Data Visualization:

Bar Charts: Show the count of restaurants by location or cuisine type.
Histograms: Visualize the distribution of restaurant ratings or average costs.
Heatmaps: Visualize the correlation between variables like cost, votes, and ratings.
Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between continuous variables like average cost and ratings.
Statistical Analysis:

Perform hypothesis testing to determine if there's a significant difference between restaurant ratings based on location or the availability of online orders.
Insights:

Identify which factors (e.g., cuisine type, location, price range) have the most influence on restaurant ratings.
Highlight the cities or areas where people are more inclined to give better ratings.
Examine how the availability of online ordering or table booking correlates with a restaurant's success.
Example Use Cases:
